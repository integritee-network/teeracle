# Demo to show that an enclave can update the exchange rate only when
#   1. it is a registered enclave
#   2. and that the code used is reliable -> the enclave is in the teeracle whitelist.
# The teeracle's whitelist has to be empty at the start. So run it with a clean node state

# setup:
# run all on localhost:
#   integritee-node purge-chain --dev
#   integritee-node --dev -lpallet_teeracle=debug,parity_ws=error,aura=error,sc_basic_authorship=error
#   integritee-service init_shard
#   integritee-service shielding-key
#   integritee-service signing-key
#   integritee-service run
#
# then run this script

# usage:
#   demo_teeracle_whitelist.sh -p <NODEPORT> -P <WORKERPORT> -d <DURATION> -i <WORKER_UPDATE_INTERVAL>
